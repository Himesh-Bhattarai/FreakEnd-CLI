> **The backend starter your fake frameworks wish they could be.**

Built for devs who don’t waste time on boilerplate BS.  
This CLI gives you a clean, fast, modular backend setup — like *now*.

**Fork it. Use it. Break it. Build with it.  
Just don’t clone the damn idea, slap a new name on it, and act like it’s yours.**

## 💥 What Freakend CLI Does
- freakend init — spins up your backend project like a beast
- freakend add login -em — drops a ready-to-run login feature into your stack
- Auto-creates structure: routes, models, services, config, utils
- Clean, scalable, testable out the gate

No more tutorials. No more copy-paste spaghetti. Just code that *works*.

## ⚠️ License & Respect

This project is open-source under the **MIT License**.  
Use it. Learn from it. Level up with it.  
But don’t sell, rebrand, or act like you made it.

**I built this to help devs — not to feed your startup hustle.**

## 💬 Made by Mr. Chanchal

I don’t drop half-baked side projects.  
I build tools I actually use — and this one’s built for world war III.
